        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <h3>My name is Ogboi Ikechukwu Bright. An undergraduate of software Engineering from Babcock University, Ilisan, Nigeria. I am skilled in web development technology with extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, PHP, SQL and node.js. Also I have deep knowledge and foundation in c++ and Python, currently undergoing a course in the advanced field of python AI development. I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria, which is the technological hub of Nigeria's tech industry, hence I have easy access to world-class technology firms like New Horizons. Participating in an undergraduate programme in software engineering at Babcock University, I have a full and rich educational path ahead of me, where I can learn frameworks like Java, React Native, Lua, for mobile app development and cloud engineering.</h3>
